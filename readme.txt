### Email Newsletter and Email Marketing Features

- Design [email newsletter subscription forms](https://kit.com/features/forms?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) in Kit, automatically appending them to any WordPress post or page, or displaying forms within your WordPress content using the supplied Gutenberg block and shortcode options. Perfect for building your email subscriber lists.
- Build [landing pages](https://kit.com/features/landing-pages?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) in Kit, and display them on a WordPress page to capture email subscribers
- List past [email newsletters](https://kit.com/features/email-marketing?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) on your WordPress site

= Forms =

Design [forms](https://kit.com/features/forms?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) in Kit, choosing from a variety of designs, customisable to your branding.

Sign up forms can be configured to:

- Send free content, such as a PDF
- Display when the user is about to leave the page
- Subscribe to an email newsletter, with powerful tagging and segmentation options

Embedding Kit forms on your WordPress web site with the Kit Plugin is quick and simple:

- Choose a default form to be displayed below each individual Post Type (Pages, Posts and other public Post Types, such as WooCommerce Products)
- Choose a specific email marketing form to be displayed below a specific Page, Post or custom post type
- Turn off form embedding at both site wide and/or individual Page/Post level

For greater control, Kit's email marketing subscription forms can be displayed in specific sections of your WordPress site's content, sidebars and footers by:

- Using the Kit Forms block in Gutenberg
- Using the `[convertkit]` shortcode in the Classic Editor

Start collecting email subscribers today!

### Send Email Newsletters

Use Kit's [email marketing](https://kit.com/features/email-marketing?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) feature to build and send email newsletters to your subscribers and leads, with options to send email newsletters to segments of your subscriber list.

Embed existing email newsletters on your WordPress web site, ensuring visitors never miss your email newsletter content, by:

- Using the Kit Broadcasts block in Gutenberg
- Using the `[convertkit_broadcasts]` shortcode in the Classic Editor

= Landing Pages =

Design [landing pages](https://kit.com/features/landing-pages?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) in Kit's intuitive editor, choosing from a variety of designs, customisable to your branding and ideal for building your email marketing list or selling a product.

Landing pages can then be embedded on your WordPress web site. Simply create or edit a WordPress Page, choose the Kit landing page from the Kit meta box settings to display, and you're all set to begin growing your email subscribers list.

= Sell Products =

Embed buttons (or link text) to sell your Kit Products in seconds - whether that's digital goods, paid email newsletters, music, coaching and more.

### List Email Newsletters

Automatically publish your past email newsletters to WordPress Posts, defining a WordPress author, category and cut-off date within the Plugin's settings.

Prefer to just list existing broadcasts, each linked to your Kit profile? Use the Broadcasts block or shortcode to embed your existing newsletters in any WordPress Page, Post or Custom Post Type.

### Paid (and free) Membership Sites

Require email subscribers to either purchase a [Kit Product](https://kit.com/features/commerce), or subscribe for free, to access your content with Kit's Member Content feature - whether that's a course, ebook, digital download, album, presets, coaching and more. 

Subscribers access their membership by entering their email address, receiving a one time passcode by email and clicking the link in the email. That's it - no complex paid membership plugins or payment gateways to configure.

There's no limit to the number of Kit Products you can create, and each can be assigned to one or more WordPress Pages and Posts, instantly turning them into membership only content for your paid subscribers.
