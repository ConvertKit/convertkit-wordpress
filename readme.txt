ConvertKit is an email marketing and email newsletter platform for capturing email subscribers and leads from your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

[ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) makes it easy to grow your email subscribers lists, sell more products and send targeted email newsletters - all by easily embedding email marketing / email subscriber forms anywhere on your WordPress web site.

= Email Marketing and Email Newsletter Features =

- Design [subscription forms](https://convertkit.com/features/forms?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) in ConvertKit, automatically appending them to any WordPress post or page, or displaying forms within your WordPress content using the supplied Gutenberg block and shortcode options. Perfect for building your email subscriber lists.
- Build [landing pages](https://convertkit.com/features/landing-pages?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) in ConvertKit, and display them on a WordPress page to capture email subscribers
- List past [email newsletters](https://convertkit.com/features/email-marketing?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) on your WordPress site

= Forms =

Design [forms](https://convertkit.com/features/forms?utm_source=wordpress&utm_term=en_US&utm_content=readme) in ConvertKit, choosing from a variety of designs, customisable to your branding.

Sign up forms can be configured to:

- Send free content, such as a PDF
- Display when the user is about to leave the page
- Subscribe to an email newsletter, with powerful tagging and segmentation options

Embedding ConvertKit forms on your WordPress web site with the ConvertKit Plugin is quick and simple:

- Choose a default form to be displayed below each individual Post Type (Pages, Posts and other public Post Types, such as WooCommerce Products)
- Choose a specific email marketing form to be displayed below a specific Page, Post or custom post type
- Turn off form embedding at both site wide and/or individual Page/Post level

For greater control, ConvertKit's email marketing subscription forms can be displayed in specific sections of your WordPress site's content, sidebars and footers by:

- Using the ConvertKit Forms block in Gutenberg
- Using the `[convertkit]` shortcode in the Classic Editor
